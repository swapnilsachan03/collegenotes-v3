              CollegeNotes began with a simple idea of sharing the discrete mathematics notes that I was making during the third semester of my college. At that time, I didn't know much about development, so I made a simple HTML and CSS powered static website by linking a few webpages, made it live and called it a day. But it was the time when that simple website got immense traffic and positive response that I understood the potential of that idea. I was overwhelmed by the requests for more content that I was getting from my friends and other people. So I decided to make it a full-fledged website and take it on as a full-time side project.

              <br/><br/>

              Three months later, I started working on it and developed it end-to-end. I added a lot of features on the admin as well as the client side (such as dark and light themes, a search bar, an authentication system, features for favoriting subjects and bookmarking notes for users, and interactive subject, notes & user management systems on the admin side). I also tried to make the UI more minimal and user-friendly.
            
              <br/><br/>

              Till now, only I have been working on this website, but I am planning to make it a community-driven project and make it a platform for students to share their notes and other study materials. I am also planning to add a lot of features to this website in the future, and maybe roll out mobile apps for better accessibility.

              When I started out with the development of this website, I planned on using NextJS and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend. But I didn't know much about these technologies at that time, so as I started moving forward, I realized that I was making a lot of mistakes and the code was getting very messy. Owing to that, I made changes to the frameworks and libraries that I was going to use and settled with this tech stack:

            <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
              <li>NextJS & Tailwind CSS for front-end development</li>
              <li>Zustand for state management</li>
              <li>ExpressJS with NodeJS for back-end development</li>
              <li>MongoDB as a database</li>
              <li>Various JavaScript libraries such as React Quill, Bcrypt, Sharp, Mongoose, etc.</li>
